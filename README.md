#LinkIt ONE Panorama Photography

This tutorial guides you to utilize the **LinkIt ONE** development board's to generate panorama photographs using four **ArduCAM Mini** cameras shooting at the same time. 

By the end of this tutorial you'll have a LinkIt ONE board taking beautiful pictures with fisheye lens cameras, uploading them to an image processing server and generating outstanding panorama photographs. The range of possibilites is extremely wide from this point. You’ll be able to make good contributions to Google Street View, create 360º selfie sticks, Android apps with PanoramaGL library or even mounting it on a quadcopter!

You will need a Linux server instance up and running as well as other open-source software. We will give you some tips to deploy everything if you do not have done it already. 

> Full details on downloading and installing the Arduino IDE and LinkIt ONE SDK then configuring the IDE and upgrading the board firmware are provided in the LinkIt ONE quick start guide. Complete this before you continue if you haven’t already set up your development environment.
